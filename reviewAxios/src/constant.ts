export const BASE_URL = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/'
// This line defines and exports a constant named `BASE_URL` with the value 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/'.
//
// Explanation:
// - `export const` is used to create a named export, meaning `BASE_URL` can be imported and used in other modules.
// - `BASE_URL` is a string that holds the base URL of an API. In this case, it's set to 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/', which is a public API often used for testing and prototyping.
//
// Usage:
// - `BASE_URL` can be used as a starting point for building full API endpoint URLs. 
//   For example, in another file, you might concatenate `BASE_URL` with specific endpoints like 'users' or 'posts' to make HTTP requests.
